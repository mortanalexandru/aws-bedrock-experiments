COVID-19 has \\r\\nhad a catastrophic effect on the world, resulting in more than 6 million deaths \\r\\nworldwide. After the first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness \\r\\nwere reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 \\r\\nrapidly disseminated worldwide. This compelled the World Health Organization \\r\\n(WHO) to declare it a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Even though substantial \\r\\nprogress in clinical research has led to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2, \\r\\nmany countries continue to have outbreaks of this viral illness. These outbreaks \\r\\nare primarily attributed to the emergence of mutant variants of the virus.\\xa0Like \\r\\nother RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 adapts with genetic evolution and developing \\r\\nmutations. This results in mutant variants that may have different \\r\\ncharacteristics than their ancestral strains. Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 \\r\\nhave been described during the course of this pandemic, among which only a few \\r\\nare considered variants of concern (VOCs). Based on the epidemiological update \\r\\nby the WHO,\\xa05 SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been identified since the beginning of the \\r\\npandemic: Alpha (B.1.1.7): First variant of concern, which was described in the \\r\\nUnited Kingdom (UK) in late December 2020. Beta (B.1.351): First reported in \\r\\nSouth Africa in December 2020. Gamma (P.1): First reported in Brazil in early \\r\\nJanuary 2021. Delta (B.1.617.2):\\xa0First reported in India in December 2020. \\r\\nOmicron\\xa0(B.1.1.529): First reported in South Africa in November 2021. Despite \\r\\nthe unprecedented speed of vaccine development against the prevention of \\r\\nCOVID-19 and robust global mass vaccination efforts, the emergence of new \\r\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants threatens to overturn the progress made in limiting the \\r\\nspread of this disease.\\xa0This review aims to comprehensively describe the \\r\\netiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of COVID-19. This \\r\\nreview also provides an overview of the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the \\r\\nguideline-recommended treatment (as of January 2023) for managing this disease.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nCopyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.\\r\\n\\r\\nPMID: 32150360\\r\\n\\r\\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosure: Marco Cascella declares no relevant \\r\\nfinancial relationships with ineligible companies.

A review of the history \\r\\nshows that the term \"diabetes\" was first used by Apollonius of Memphis around \\r\\n250\\xa0to 300 BC. Ancient Greek, Indian, and Egyptian civilizations discovered the \\r\\nsweet nature of urine in this condition, and hence the propagation of the word \\r\\nDiabetes Mellitus came into being. Mering and Minkowski, in 1889, discovered the \\r\\nrole of the pancreas in the pathogenesis of diabetes. In 1922 Banting, Best, and \\r\\nCollip purified the hormone insulin from the pancreas of cows at the University \\r\\nof Toronto, leading to the availability of an effective treatment for diabetes \\r\\nin 1922. Over the years, exceptional work has taken place, and multiple \\r\\ndiscoveries, as well as management strategies, have been created to tackle this \\r\\ngrowing problem. Unfortunately, even today, diabetes is one of the most common \\r\\nchronic diseases in the country and worldwide. In the US, it remains as the \\r\\nseventh leading cause of death. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease, \\r\\ninvolving inappropriately elevated blood glucose levels. DM has several \\r\\ncategories, including type 1, type 2, maturity-onset diabetes of the young \\r\\n(MODY), gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and secondary causes due to \\r\\nendocrinopathies, steroid use, etc. The main subtypes of DM are Type 1 diabetes \\r\\nmellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which classically result \\r\\nfrom defective insulin secretion (T1DM) and/or action (T2DM). T1DM presents in \\r\\nchildren or adolescents, while T2DM is thought to affect middle-aged and older \\r\\nadults who have prolonged hyperglycemia due to poor lifestyle and dietary \\r\\nchoices. The pathogenesis for T1DM and T2DM is drastically different, and \\r\\ntherefore each type has various etiologies, presentations, and treatments.\\r\\n\\r\\nCopyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.\\r\\n\\r\\nPMID: 31855345\\r\\n\\r\\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosure: Amit Sapra declares no relevant \\r\\nfinancial relationships with ineligible companies.

A review of the history \\r\\nshows that the term \"diabetes\" was first used by Apollonius of Memphis around \\r\\n250\\xa0to 300 BC. Ancient Greek, Indian, and Egyptian civilizations discovered the \\r\\nsweet nature of urine in this condition, and hence the propagation of the word \\r\\nDiabetes Mellitus came into being. Mering and Minkowski, in 1889, discovered the \\r\\nrole of the pancreas in the pathogenesis of diabetes. In 1922 Banting, Best, and \\r\\nCollip purified the hormone insulin from the pancreas of cows at the University \\r\\nof Toronto, leading to the availability of an effective treatment for diabetes \\r\\nin 1922. Over the years, exceptional work has taken place, and multiple \\r\\ndiscoveries, as well as management strategies, have been created to tackle this \\r\\ngrowing problem. Unfortunately, even today, diabetes is one of the most common \\r\\nchronic diseases in the country and worldwide. In the US, it remains as the \\r\\nseventh leading cause of death. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease, \\r\\ninvolving inappropriately elevated blood glucose levels. DM has several \\r\\ncategories, including type 1, type 2, maturity-onset diabetes of the young \\r\\n(MODY), gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and secondary causes due to \\r\\nendocrinopathies, steroid use, etc. The main subtypes of DM are Type 1 diabetes \\r\\nmellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which classically result \\r\\nfrom defective insulin secretion (T1DM) and/or action (T2DM). T1DM presents in \\r\\nchildren or adolescents, while T2DM is thought to affect middle-aged and older \\r\\nadults who have prolonged hyperglycemia due to poor lifestyle and dietary \\r\\nchoices. The pathogenesis for T1DM and T2DM is drastically different, and \\r\\ntherefore each type has various etiologies, presentations, and treatments.\\r\\n\\r\\nCopyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.\\r\\n\\r\\nPMID: 31855345\\r\\n\\r\\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosure: Amit Sapra declares no relevant \\r\\nfinancial relationships with ineligible companies.

COVID-19 has \\r\\nhad a catastrophic effect on the world, resulting in more than 6 million deaths \\r\\nworldwide. After the first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness \\r\\nwere reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 \\r\\nrapidly disseminated worldwide. This compelled the World Health Organization \\r\\n(WHO) to declare it a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Even though substantial \\r\\nprogress in clinical research has led to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2, \\r\\nmany countries continue to have outbreaks of this viral illness. These outbreaks \\r\\nare primarily attributed to the emergence of mutant variants of the virus.\\xa0Like \\r\\nother RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 adapts with genetic evolution and developing \\r\\nmutations. This results in mutant variants that may have different \\r\\ncharacteristics than their ancestral strains. Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 \\r\\nhave been described during the course of this pandemic, among which only a few \\r\\nare considered variants of concern (VOCs). Based on the epidemiological update \\r\\nby the WHO,\\xa05 SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been identified since the beginning of the \\r\\npandemic: Alpha (B.1.1.7): First variant of concern, which was described in the \\r\\nUnited Kingdom (UK) in late December 2020. Beta (B.1.351): First reported in \\r\\nSouth Africa in December 2020. Gamma (P.1): First reported in Brazil in early \\r\\nJanuary 2021. Delta (B.1.617.2):\\xa0First reported in India in December 2020. \\r\\nOmicron\\xa0(B.1.1.529): First reported in South Africa in November 2021. Despite \\r\\nthe unprecedented speed of vaccine development against the prevention of \\r\\nCOVID-19 and robust global mass vaccination efforts, the emergence of new \\r\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants threatens to overturn the progress made in limiting the \\r\\nspread of this disease.\\xa0This review aims to comprehensively describe the \\r\\netiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of COVID-19. This \\r\\nreview also provides an overview of the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the \\r\\nguideline-recommended treatment (as of January 2023) for managing this disease.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nCopyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.\\r\\n\\r\\nPMID: 32150360\\r\\n\\r\\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosure: Marco Cascella declares no relevant \\r\\nfinancial relationships with ineligible companies.
